1 Tensorflow MNIST study by hand;
2 NN and DL MNIST study by hand;
3 SVM study by hand;

4 go on studying about CNN/RNN of TF
5 export an Xmind/PPT about DL basic concepts
6 go on studying math & algorithm
Lecture context:
1 Use playground to show the basic concepts of tensorflow;
2 Use feedback and search issues to describe the study process;
3 To explain every concept used in the feedback and playground;

#  
step 1: 

study below example
1 digit Recognizer of Machine Leaning in action
2 digit Recognizer scikit learn 
3 digit Recognizer of Kaggle
4 digit Recognizer of Tensorflow

step 2: 

write blog summary of digit Recognizer

step 3:

study more about DL

step 4:

find some useful projects, and try to realize it via DL tech
